# Hi, I'm Sloane!

I'm a software engineer and people manager living in Columbus, OH and currently working for a NYC based digital agency, [Postlight][postlight].

I've built platforms for insurance companies, digital learning apps,--perhaps most rewardingly--[the Metropolitan Transit Authority of New York City][mta], and more. I take pride in writing robust software with an attention to detail and leading teams with empathy and trust.

My most recent projects have used Elixir and Phoenix LiveView but I have deep experience in the front-end and backend JavaScript ecosystem and relational databases (PostgreSQL is my personal favorite). In my work as a consultant I'm frequently tasked with learning new technologies in-depth to meet the client's needs.

I'm also a Haskell, LISP, and just all around functional programming enthusiast.
